rumble-bots
===========

A collection Mumble-Ruby-Bots

rumble now means also RUbymuMBLE


NOTE: You need at least opus-ruby and mumble-ruby I forked for function of these BOTS until pull requests (hopefulle) merged in perrym5 projects.


    Befor you say: Collection?, with 1 Bot? ??

    I would say: Every Collection starts with the first. No one with nothing. :D
